<h2>About Us</h2>
</div>
<p> We take second hand books from the community and provide a platform and access to everyone to come and 
issue the books. Started in 2018. Since then we have benefitted around 100+ people with 150+ books.</p>

<h2>The Idea</h2>
<!-- Aashish was here -->
<p>All readers have faced the problem of running out of books to read.And new books are hard to get apart from they being costly.Many fictional books are only read once and then kept in the shelves of people's home as a showpiece. Why deprive many of such good stories?.</p>
